# Maze-Explorer
This project, developed for the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course, aims to present a maze-exploring model that uses different search methods to explore the environment. The proposal seeks to demonstrate, in a practical and comparative way, the differences between various search techniques and logical agents, highlighting their strategies, performance, and applications in the autonomous decision-making process.
